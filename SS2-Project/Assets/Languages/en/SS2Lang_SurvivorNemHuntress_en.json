		Tucked away in a small cave about forty meters from the bottom of the valley, a single survivor sat crouched in anticipation, gazing through a visor. She saw the entire valley for what it truly was- countless hits, just waiting to be made. As soon as something even dared to poke their head out… Well, just the head would be the best case, truthfully.\n\n
		Something moved. Bow unholstered, fully drawn. That target was already dead. Just needed to wait for the perfect moment…\n\n
		…There. A single arrow whizzed through the air, hitting its target square in the back. They flailed a little bit, trying to pull it out from between their shoulders… until the arrow detonated in their body, painting the bottom of the valley a beautiful hue of rufous red.\n\n
		The assassin chuckled to herself. It was always so cute when they panicked.",
